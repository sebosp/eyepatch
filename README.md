## 3D printing

This has been printed in 3 layers:

- UV Tough resin for the main shell (black)
- Mack4D Easy Rip for the layer in contact with the skin (biocompatible resin made for auditory and dental prosthetics).
- A layer of medical grade epoxy to join the EasyRip and the UV Tough resins plus cover of the front.

## After printing and joining:

This model works best with glasses that are circular and that have thin holders:
